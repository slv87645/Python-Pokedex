# Pokedex
 Simple python application that displays information about pokemon from the popular Pokemon franchise. 
 The GUI was built using Tkinter, while the data was provided by the pypokedex library.
 Additionally, the server.py file contains a python socket that acts as microservice for the pokedex. It provides random numbers that are used for generating random pokemon.
